## Tech Stack:

 ->React + TypeScript — For a strictly typed component-based UI.

 -> Tailwind CSS — To keep styling clean, consistent, and utility-first.

 -> React Router — For seamless navigation between pages (Home, Details).

## What I Skipped (For Now):

I haven’t added tests yet — not because I don’t want to, but because I’m still getting better at writing them!
I'm actively learning and will add proper tests soon, like a true pro in progress. Stay tuned.


## About the Boilerplate:

Okay,real talk: I summoned ChatGPT to help set up the boilerplate. Just the boring parts, I swear!.
Everything from layout, logic, styling,and error handling was hand-crafted with care and curiosity.



## Future Enhancements:

->Add search + filter by language

->Add contributor stats

->Toggle view between cards & table

->Error boundaries & toast notifications
